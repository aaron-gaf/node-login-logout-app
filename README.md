# node-login-logout-app
A simple NodeJS+Express app that supports creating an account, logging in and logging out (as well as account deletion).

The app has many flaws! In all fairness though, it works per the project specifications.

The app can be tested [here](https://node-login-logout-app.herokuapp.com/). BUT, DO NOT USE ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU AS THE APP HAS MANY SECURITY FLAWS.
